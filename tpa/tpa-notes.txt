Directory for work with BMP280 temperature, pressure and altitude sensor
with Circuit Playground Express.

DATA
Data files are CSV files: uphill_data.csv and dnhill_data.csv
uphill_data.csv is starts, unfortunately, at 776 seconds rather than 0, so a little finagling is required in the plotting code

VISUALIZATION
We are trying to plot this data straight from the mu editor using the script tpa-plot.py
