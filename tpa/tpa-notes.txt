Directory for work with BMP280 temperature, pressure and altitude sensor
with Circuit Playground Express.

DATA
Data files are CSV files: uphill_data.csv and dnhill_data.csv
uphill_data.csv is starts, unfortunately, at 776 seconds rather than 0, so a little finagling is required in the plotting code

VISUALIZATION
We are trying to plot this data straight from the mu editor using the script tpa-plot.py.
I created some temporary plots using gnuplot, but in the end, we'd like to show how to do this in Python.
However, this is NOT working on my linux box, perhaps the windows install includes matplotlib??
